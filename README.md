If you would like to post a new song and share it with others, you can click the "Music" tab at the top of the navigation bar. On the "Music" webpage, you can search for a song to post by the artist name and/or track name. Once you click Search, you are presented with three tracks that most closely match your search. You have the option to play, pause, or restart a preview of the song. Once you have found the song you would like to post, click "Add to post". The title, song URL, artist, and album will automatically populate into the post form. You simply need to add your commentary within the "Content" portion of the form and click "Create Post" in order to share a song on the public feed.
